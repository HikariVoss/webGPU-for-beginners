## Reasons for learning webGPU

The reason I'm learning how to use webGPU is because I'm am interested in learning how to use webGPU is because I want to learn graphic programing with the portablity that the web offers. ie it lets me dive into more low level subjects while using the web. 

Another reason is because I'm most proficient in JS and python and don't really want to learn c++ which would be faster for the kind of the things I want to build.

I want to build a few 3D games, but mostly I just want to experiment with shaders. I would also like to do some mathmatical visulisations however that is likely easier to do in python.
